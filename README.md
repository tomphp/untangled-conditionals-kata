# Untangled Conditionals Kata

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomphp/untangled-conditionals-kata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomphp/untangled-conditionals-kata)

This repository contains a simple coding kata.

Category: **refactoring**<br>
Skill Level: **beginner**<br>
Time: **~30 mins**

This repository contains the starting code.
The logic is contained in a single method, `Pipeline.run()`.
This method contains a number of embedded `if` statements.
Your goal is to refactor the code to a more understandable and desireable state.

Remember, keep the tests passing while you refactor!

## Approach

Below you can find some resources demonstrating the approach that this kata was designed to teach.
However, I recommend you try the kata yourself first, and then review the resources.
